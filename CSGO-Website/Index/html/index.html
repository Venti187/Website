          There are a total of 34 <a class="link" href="../../Weapons-page/html/weapons.html">weapons</a> in Global
          Offensive, 19 of which are exclusive to the game. Among those 19, 10
          are replacements of old weapons, retaining their role but are modelled after new guns, and the other 9 are
          unique weapons with new roles and properties. Returning weapons also have many changes made to their general
          properties.

          <p>
            Bomb defusal is the most popular of the two "classic" game modes (the other being hostage rescue) and it's
            pretty much the go-to game mode for anybody looking to play Counter-Strike. In this game mode, the
            Terrorists must plant a bomb at one of two bomb sites (which are typically close to CT spawn), and the
            Counter-Terrorists must stop them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Terrorists win if they eliminate all enemies or plant the bomb before the round ends and it explodes (which
            takes 45 seconds; it doesn't need to explode before the round time ends but it needs to be planted).
            Counter-Terrorists win if they eliminate all enemies, defuse the bomb (which takes 10 seconds without defuse
            kit/5 seconds with defuse kit) or if round time expires before the bomb is planted.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's regarded as the most balanced game mode in terms of winnability for both sides, and for that reason it
            is the only game mode in the Active Duty map list (see Maps page for more info). Because it is "classic," it
            can be played in both Casual and Competitive games.
          </p>

      <div id="hostage-rescue-mode">
        <div class="gamemode-title">
          <h2>Hostage rescue</h2>

        <div class="section-text">
          <p>
            Hostage rescue is the other "classic" game mode in CS:GO. In this game mode, the Terrorists must protect the
            hostages near their spawn, and the Counter-Terrorists must carry at least one of the hostages and take them
            back to one of the designated "hostage rescue zones" (which are usually located near CT spawn). Hostages
            cannot be killed, but players on both sides will lose money if they hurt a hostage.
            <br>
            <br>
            Terrorists win if they eliminate all enemies or if round time expires before a hostage is rescued.
            Counter-Terrorists win if they eliminate all enemies or rescue at least one of the hostages.
            <br>
            <br>
            This game mode is generally regarded as less balanced than bomb defusal, as the Counter-Terrorists'
            equipment makes them less suited for offensive attacks (most CT weapons are balanced towards being defensive
            and slowing the enemy down, compared to their higher-damage T counterparts), among other reasons. Because it
            is "classic," it can be played in both Casual and Competitive games.
