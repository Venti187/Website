          <b>Global Offensive (CS:GO)</b> is a first-person shooter video game which is a part of the
          Counter-Strike series. It was announced to the public on August 12, 2011, and is developed by Valve
          Corporation
          and their partner, Hidden Path Entertainment. The game was later released on August 21, 2012 for the
          Playstation
          3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, macOS and later Linux as a downloadable title.

          There are a total of 34 <a class="link" href="../../Weapons-page/html/weapons.html">weapons</a> in Global
          Offensive, 19 of which are exclusive to the game. Among those 19, 10
          are replacements of old weapons, retaining their role but are modelled after new guns, and the other 9 are
          unique weapons with new roles and properties. Returning weapons also have many changes made to their general

        <div class="section-text">
          <p>
            Bomb defusal is the most popular of the two "classic" game modes (the other being hostage rescue) and it's
            pretty much the go-to game mode for anybody looking to play Counter-Strike. In this game mode, the
            Terrorists must plant a bomb at one of two bomb sites (which are typically close to CT spawn), and the
            Counter-Terrorists must stop them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Terrorists win if they eliminate all enemies or plant the bomb before the round ends and it explodes (which
            takes 45 seconds; it doesn't need to explode before the round time ends but it needs to be planted).
            Counter-Terrorists win if they eliminate all enemies, defuse the bomb (which takes 10 seconds without defuse
            kit/5 seconds with defuse kit) or if round time expires before the bomb is planted.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's regarded as the most balanced game mode in terms of winnability for both sides, and for that reason it
            is the only game mode in the Active Duty map list (see <a class="link"
              href="../../Maps-page/html/maps.html">Maps</a> page for more info). Because it is "classic," it
            can be played in both Casual and Competitive games.

          <p>
            Hostage rescue is the other "classic" game mode in CS:GO. In this game mode, the Terrorists must protect the
            hostages near their spawn, and the Counter-Terrorists must carry at least one of the hostages and take them
            back to one of the designated "hostage rescue zones" (which are usually located near CT spawn). Hostages
            cannot be killed, but players on both sides will lose money if they hurt a hostage.
            <br>
            <br>
            Terrorists win if they eliminate all enemies or if round time expires before a hostage is rescued.
            Counter-Terrorists win if they eliminate all enemies or rescue at least one of the hostages.
            <br>
            <br>
            This game mode is generally regarded as less balanced than bomb defusal, as the Counter-Terrorists'
            equipment makes them less suited for offensive attacks (most CT weapons are balanced towards being defensive
            and slowing the enemy down, compared to their higher-damage T counterparts), among other reasons. Because it
            is "classic," it can be played in both Casual and Competitive games.

            <br>
            Officially included in the Counter-Strike series for the first time with CS:GO, deathmatch is a game mode
            that evolved from a popular community-made custom game mode for earlier games in the series. It's a basic
            team deathmatch setting that is played on either Active Duty or Reserves maps (depending on the server) and
            it's a great way to warm up your game and your aim against real opponents.
            <br>
            <br>
            Players infinitely respawn with armor randomly across the map and can select any weapon for free (minus
            grenades and weapons unavailable to the player's current team). The only objective is to get as many points
            as possible before the round ends (typically 10 minutes). Some weapons give more points than others

            Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the first Counter-Strike game to include a built-in competitive mode to
            appeal to the professional and competitive player by being structured similarly to professional tournament
            play, including swapping sides, friendly fire, and locked teams.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unlike casual mode, competitive mode always pits two teams of 5 against each other in a 30 round match. The
            roundtime is 1 minute 55 seconds and the bomb timer is 40 seconds. It is not possible to switch sides during
            the game except at the halftime. After the first 15 rounds, the game reaches halftime and the two teams will
            switch sides. The first team to score 16 points wins the game. If both teams score a total of 15 points by
            the end of the 30th round, the match will end in a tie. If the player has a rank then they are revealed to
            all players when the match has ended. Games can also end prematurely if one team surrenders to the other. A
            vote to surrender must be unanimously agreed upon, and the vote is locked until a team member abandons the
            match.
            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, players are required to have a profile rank of at least Private Rank 2 to be eligible for
            competitive matchmaking.
