            On April 10, 2020, Anubis was moved from Scrimmage to Competitive after only ten days of being featured in
            the game. It was the second map to get moved into Competitive since the introduction of Scrimmage, the first
            being new Cache. On May 3, 2021, Anubis was removed from the game, however just over 1 year later, it was

            <b>Ancient (de_ancient)</b> is an official Bomb Defusal map for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, released
            as part
            of Operation Broken Fang on the December 3, 2020 update. Initially released as part of the Reserves Group,
            the May 3, 2021 update moved Ancient to the Active Duty map group, replacing <a class="link"

            <br>
            <br>
            Ancient appears to take place in an archaeological site in the middle of a rainforest (likely in central
            America). Across the map there are plenty of artefacts such as pots, artworks and monuments which resemble
            those from the Aztec empire. Each bombsite is referred to as a 'plaza' in the signage and has a distinct
            theme color. Bombsite A is colored orange, with tarps, paint and signs and Bombsite B is a pale blue color.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the IEM Rio 2022 Major, on the November 18, 2022 update, it was added to the Active Duty Group. This
            is the second community-made map which has made it into the Active Duty Group after Cache.

            <br>
            <br>
            The map is set in a small town with European architecture. In the Global Offensive version, the presence of
            the Separatist faction suggests that the map is definitely set in Italy, as evidenced by the signs written
            in Italian seen around the map. However, the separatist faction is also present in the Basque country of
            Spain and France, so it's plausible it could be there, too.
            The map is loosely rectangular, with the Counter-Terrorists spawning on one corner of the map and the
            Terrorists on the diagonally opposite corner, and the two bombsites sitting at the other two corners.

            <br>
            The map is themed like a Middle Eastern town, but because of its close resemblance to Moroccan style

            <br>
            The map takes place in a warehouse containing nuclear materials or a nuclear power plant. In Global
            Offensive, the original version of the map takes place a German nuclear power plant, while the revamped
            version takes place in an American one. Unlike most Counter-Strike bomb defusal maps, the map revolves
            around a central structure rather than
            multiple lanes, with the two bombsites being overlapped on top of each other.

            head-on or attempt to destroy the overpass itself by bombing the pillar below.

            <br>
            The Counter-Terrorists spawn in bombsite A, where the disabled cargo truck is located at. Meanwhile, the

            can easily be accessed from a stairwell. In here, snipers

            Vertigo is based on a skyscraper that is under construction and centered the conflict between the

            while the CTs must prevent them from achieving their goal. Both bombsites and the Counter-Terrorist spawn
            are located on the upper floor of the map, whilst the Terrorist spawn is located on the lower floor in the

            <br>
            <br>
            With the introduction of Operation Breakout, Cache became an official map. It was introduced to the Active
            Duty map pool being the first and only community map to do so, but was since removed and replaced by

            <br>
            <br>
            Cache was reworked and shown to the public for the first time on 29th September 2019 during the ESL One New

            <b>Cobblestone (de_cobblestone)</b> formerly known as Cobble, is a bomb defusal map featured in the
            Counter-Strike series. It was added to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in the Winter Offensive update
            alongside the map <a class="link" onclick="smoothScroll('overpass')">Overpass</a>. It is currently in
            Defusal Group Sigma and is available for Casual matchmaking,
            Deathmatch and the B bombsite is used for Wingman.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cobblestone is a large-sized map, and had quite significant vertical combat in its earlier iterations. In
            earlier versions, it is fairly easy to take fall damage due to the high height of many of the map's drops.
            Bots in early versions of the game will also occasionally fall to their deaths. Additionally, this map is
            open, making snipers very useful.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bombsite A is located right next to the Counter-Terrorist spawn, and bombsite B is located around a large
            statue. Terrorists spawn in lower area with a sniper tower nearby, a tunnel to bombsite A and stairs to
            bombsite B. Path to bombsite A leads to a very open area leading either to A long, underpass or to bombsite
            B via a connector. Path to B leads to tunnels with B long and a drop.
            <br>
            Wingman version of the map has only bombsite B, with Terrorists spawning in tunnels and Counter-Terrorists
            spawning in the connector between A and B bombsites.

            <b>Dust II (de_dust2)</b> also known as Dust2 is a Bomb Defusal map featured in the Counter-Strike series.
            It is the successor to Dust.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the most popular maps in the Counter-Strike series due to its strong balance, Dust II is an iconic
            map for the Counter-Strike franchise. It is widely played on many servers and is a popular choice for
            Counter-Strike tournaments as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            The map appears to be set in the Middle East, similar to its predecessor Dust. An earlier version of the map
            lack many identifying features, with the only identifying features being what looks like sandstone textures
            for walls and sand for floor.
            <br>
            <br>
            Later games added more visually identifiable features to show the map's setting. The original Global
            Offensive version featured Islamic architecture and presence of military and conflict activity such as
            Humvees and bombed walls, reflecting a contemporary view of the Middle East.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the revamped version, the map is set in Morocco, which is not in the geographic region of Middle East,
            but featured similar architectural styles.
            <br>
            <br>
            The map can be loosely divided into three interconnected lanes: Tunnels connecting T Spawn to bombsite B,
            mid connecting T Spawn to CT Spawn and catwalk, and Long connecting T Spawn to bombsite A. Pathways branch
            out from these lanes and form an interconnected map allowing for tactical player movements.
